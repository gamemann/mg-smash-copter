This is a game to demonstrate the capabilities of the [**Dot collection**](https://moddingcommunity.com/co/4-dot-assets) built on-top of [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/) and [TMC's gaming platform](https://moddingcommunity.com/play). In this 3D game, players spawn on top of platforms balanced on single pillars while a cannon in the middle shoots props up into the air that may knock them off. Players must survive in teams or individually to win (depending on server setup). This is heavily inspired off of a classic Counter-Strike: Source MiniGames map called [**mg_3k_smash_lego_copter**](https://gamebanana.com/mods/127650) ([gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZED7S1dfBY)).

**This project and the assets under it are COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE**. You are free to use, modify, and distribute them under the terms of the MIT license. The only thing not open source is the back-end web infrastructure. So if you opt into using your own authentication backend instead of integrating with TMC, you will need to build and integrate your own back-end infrastructure.

## From Maintainer & WARNING
This project, along with every asset it is built on, was built initially with **Claude Code** and will continue to be maintained and extended using it. This is because I (`gamemann`) cannot build the entire TMC platform alone (I wish I could lol).

**Please treat this as partially tested.** It has its own headless test suite and that suite passes, but very little of this has been in front of real players yet. Expect rough edges, and please report anything you run into.

I intend on reviewing code, testing, and editing documentation regularly. If you're interested in helping out, please let me know!

## How it plays
A round has two halves.

**The first two minutes are about keeping your footing.** Two to six teams stand on platforms balanced on single pillars, forty metres up. Nobody can hurt anybody. A platform leans toward whoever is standing on it, and past sixteen degrees it comes off its pillar and takes everybody on it down to the floor. Meanwhile a cannon in the middle aims at the platforms that are still up and throws props at them, getting heavier as the round goes on:

| Tier | Props | What it does to a platform |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Crate, tyre, cone | Wobbles it |
| 2 | Barrel, boulder | Tips it. A barrel also explodes |
| 3 | Container, slab | Knocks a corner off it |
| 4 | Monolith | Destroys it, with everybody on it |

**Shift is a brake, not a sprint.** Running is the default speed, and running is what tips a platform. A running player leans it about three times as far as a standing one, so the way to cross a platform somebody else is standing on is to slow down.

**The last ninety seconds are a fight.** Everybody still standing is teleported to a corner pad in the sky with random weapons from [zee-dot-weapons](https://github.com/gamemann/zee-dot-weapons). Catwalks join the corners to a ring in the middle. The last team standing wins.

A third of rounds are **special rounds**, which change the rules for a while: `barrage`, `heavy`, `feather` (low gravity), `slick` (ice), `gale` (wind), `quake`, `jelly` (loose pillars), `downpour` and `rush`. Two can overlap.

The field is re-rolled every round from eight **layouts**, from the full grid down to two islands: `full`, `checker`, `islands`, `spine`, `airfield`, `gauntlet`, `broadside` and `hollow`. Two of them park a **chopper**: the pilot flies it with the movement keys and drops crates on whatever is underneath, and the passenger can shoot.

When you fall, you are out until the next round and watch somebody on your own side who is still up.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **WASD** | Move. In the chopper: W/S tilt forward and back, A/D turn |
| **Shift** | Walk (the brake) |
| **Space** / **Ctrl** | Jump / crouch. In the chopper: up / down |
| **E** | Get into or out of the chopper |
| **Mouse 1** | Fire (in the showdown). In the chopper: drop a crate |
| **1**-**5** | Weapon slots (in the showdown) |
| **F5** | First or third person |
| **Y** / **U** | Chat / chat to your side |
| **V** | Push to talk |

While you are out: **Mouse 1** / **Mouse 2** watch the next or previous player, and **F5** switches between their eyes and behind them (if the server allows it).

## Getting started
You need [Godot 4.7](https://godotengine.org/download). The game is built from many Dot addons, each in its own repository, so the easiest way to get everything is [dot-bootstrap](https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-bootstrap). It clones every project and links the addons into each one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-bootstrap.git
cd dot-bootstrap
./bootstrap.sh
cd projects/mg-smash-copter
./game.sh
```

On Windows, run `bootstrap.ps1` instead and open the project in Godot.

`game.sh` does everything else:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `./game.sh` | Play offline against bots |
| `./game.sh online` | Start a local server and the browser client, and print the link to open |
| `./game.sh online down` | Stop them |
| `./game.sh server` | Start a local dedicated server only |
| `./game.sh test` | Check every script and run every test suite |
| `./game.sh shot` | Save a screenshot to `screenshots/`. `./game.sh shot --help` lists the views |
| `./game.sh help` | All of the options |

`online` and `server` use [dot-server-deploy](https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-server-deploy), which bootstrap clones next to this one. Run its `./setup.sh` once first.

## Running a server
Settings are cvars (or environment variables like `SC_LAYOUT_IDS`). Set them in the server's config, on the command line, or live from the console. Most of them take effect straight away.

```
sc_survival_seconds 120     // length of the first half
sc_showdown_seconds 90      // length of the fight
sc_teams 2                  // number of sides (up to six)
sc_stiffness 7.0            // lower is wobblier
sc_motion_gain 2.0          // how much more a running player tips a platform than a walking one
sc_cannon_interval 1.9      // seconds between shots
sc_cannon_max_tier 4        // 2 = nothing that destroys a platform outright
sc_special_chance 34        // percent of rounds that are special
sc_chopper 1                // 0 = no chopper on any layout
sc_min_players 4            // fill the round with bots up to this
sc_bot_spread 7             // bot aim error in degrees (lower is sharper)
sc_spectate_camera 1        // 0 = anybody may watch anybody, 1 = own side only, 2 = nobody
```

`--sc-layout-ids=checker` (or `SC_LAYOUT_IDS=checker`) plays one layout all evening. An empty server fills itself with bots, because a round needs two sides.

Console commands: `sc_status`, `sc_net`, `sc_layouts` and `sc_specials`.

### Admin commands
These come from [dot-moderation](https://github.com/modcommunity/dot-moderation): `noclip`, `freeze`, `speed`, `gravity`, `god`, `buddha`, `hp`, `slay`, `slap`, `rename` and the teleports. `blind <player> [on|off|seconds]` blacks out that player's screen, and `beacon <player> [on|off]` puts a ring and a ping on them for everybody. `respawn`, `give` and `strip` are turned off, and `modtools` says why.

### Stats and achievements
The server counts rounds survived, showdowns won, people knocked out in the corners, falls, platforms you tipped, and props that landed on your platform and missed you. Achievements are built on those. They are kept in memory unless the server sets `SC_PROGRESS_DIRECTORY`, and only reported to the website with `SC_REPORT_PROGRESS` and a credential.

## Testing

```bash
./game.sh test                  # every script parses, then every suite runs
./game.sh test headless_run     # one suite
```

| Suite | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| `headless_run` | The game itself: platforms, the cannon, layouts, special rounds, the showdown and bots |
| `headless_net` | A server and a client in one process, over the network code |
| `dedicated` | A real server: boots, loads the game, runs its commands |

[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) has the design decisions and the reasoning behind them.

## Not done yet
- Other players' guns aren't drawn in their hands yet (yours is).
- Bots fall off more than they shoot.
- There is no settings menu, so volume, mouse sensitivity and field of view can't be changed yet.
- The sounds are generated stand-ins. Dropping a file such as `audio/cannon_fire.ogg` in replaces one.
