## The things that go wrong on purpose, as a catalogue of documents.
##
## [b]A special round is a set of multipliers, never a branch.[/b] Nothing in this file
## knows what a platform or a cannon is: it produces an [Active] with nine numbers on it
## and the rest of the game multiplies its own figures by them. That is the difference
## between adding a tenth special and editing nine files — and it is why the low-gravity
## round makes the props fall slower, the platforms lean lazily and the jumps hang without
## one line of code mentioning any of the three.
##
## [b]Two kinds, and the second one is the point.[/b] A special rolled at the start of a
## round is announced and lasts the round: it is a variant a player can plan around. One
## that arrives at ninety seconds is not — [DotRandomSchedule] decides when from the tick
## alone, so a server and a replay of it turn the gravity off at the same instant, and
## nobody on the server saw it coming.

## One thing that can go wrong, and what it multiplies.
##
## Every field is a multiplier on a configured number and every default is the identity,
## so a special that sets one field changes one thing and says so by omission.
