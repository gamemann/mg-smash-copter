extends "sc_prop_net.gd"

## What a chopper replicates, through [DotVehicleNetSync].
##
## [b]It extends the prop behaviour rather than sitting beside it.[/b] A chopper is another
## body the server moves and the client draws, so the bridge keeps ONE table of replicated
## bodies and one `pull` loop over it; a second parallel table is a second thing that can
## disagree about which of them exists.
##
## [b]`extends` a relative path, not a `class_name`.[/b] A mounted dot-cloud pack's globals
## are not registered in the host, so a game that named its own base class would compile
## here, mount there and have every script in it dead with nothing reporting a thing.

## drawn where the server says it is and nothing more.

## Declared from the addon's own table.
##
## [b]The type is resolved from a STRING, and that is why the table is written the way it
## is.[/b] [DotVehicleNetSync] never mentions a dot-net `class_name`, because a script
## naming a class the project does not have fails to parse and takes every script that
## references it down with it — so a game without dot-net can still use dot-vehicle.
## Resolving `DotNetVar.Type[spec.type]` is the game's half of that bargain and can only be
## done here.
