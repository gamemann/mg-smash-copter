## What a networked player replicates: the movement state, their health, and whether they
## are flying.
##
## [b]The movement half is dot-player-controller's own table and is not written here.[/b]
## [DotFpsNetSync.state_specs] is what the controller says its state is, in the
## quantisation it says it wants; a game that listed the fields itself would be a second
## copy to drift — and the type names in that table are STRINGS precisely so the addon can
## describe a dot-net layout without naming dot-net.
##
## [b]The two game fields are not derivable from the movement.[/b] Health decides whether a
## body is drawn at all, and riding decides whether the client predicts them; a client that
## worked either out for itself would be running a second copy of the rules.
##
## [b]Which side somebody is on is deliberately NOT here.[/b] It changes once a round at
## most, and a per-tick field for it would send the same three bits sixty-four times a
## second for ever to carry a fact that arrives reliably in a JOIN and a TEAM. The rule this
## game follows: a per-tick property for what changes per tick, an event for what changes on
## a decision.

## Somebody this client is watching used their weapon, [param times] times since the last
## snapshot. What a game draws a muzzle flash from.

## something worthless if it arrives late, costs a packet per shot per watcher, and

## a weapon the same snapshot says has been holstered. A four-bit counter inside the
## snapshot cannot do any of those: a watcher who missed a snapshot sees it jump by two and
## plays one flash instead of two, which is the correct amount of wrong.
##
## The world model is null here and that is not a gap. Drawing somebody else's gun in their
## hands needs a character with a hand mount, which this game has not built — see its
## CLAUDE.md. What the state is for meanwhile is the HUD and the fact that it is CARRIED at
## all, and `ZeeWeaponNet.apply` is written to take a null model and still answer.
