## What a networked player replicates: the movement state, their health, and whether they
## are flying.
##
## [b]The movement half is dot-player-controller's own table and is not written here.[/b]
## [DotFpsNetSync.state_specs] is what the controller says its state is, in the
## quantisation it says it wants; a game that listed the fields itself would be a second
## copy to drift — and the type names in that table are STRINGS precisely so the addon can
## describe a dot-net layout without naming dot-net.
##
## [b]The two game fields are not derivable from the movement.[/b] Health decides whether a
## body is drawn at all, and riding decides whether the client predicts them; a client that
## worked either out for itself would be running a second copy of the rules.
##
## [b]Which side somebody is on is deliberately NOT here.[/b] It changes once a round at
## most, and a per-tick field for it would send the same three bits sixty-four times a
## second for ever to carry a fact that arrives reliably in a JOIN and a TEAM. The rule this
## game follows: a per-tick property for what changes per tick, an event for what changes on
## a decision.
