## What a platform replicates: two angles, a height and a state. Four numbers.
##
## [b]The cheapest thing on the wire and the most important thing on the screen.[/b] A
## platform is not a rigid body — see [ScPlatforms] for why it must not be — so there is no
## transform to send and no solver to agree with. What the server has decided is a lean and
## a sink, and those are exactly what it says.
##
## [b]It is also the one replicated thing in this game that is the FLOOR.[/b] Everything
## else being a snapshot behind is a cosmetic cost; a floor being a snapshot behind is a
## player standing on something that is not there. So the lean is interpolated — it moves
## continuously and a client between two snapshots should be between two leans — and the
## STATE is not: a platform that has come off its pillar takes its collider away on the
## tick the client is told, not smoothly over the next three.

## Which platform in the field this is. Set on both ends; the wire never carries it per
## tick, because it does not change.
