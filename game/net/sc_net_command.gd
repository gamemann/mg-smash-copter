## One tick of a player's intent, on the wire: a movement command and a weapon slot.
##
## [b]The same command walks a player and flies a chopper, and that is this game's design
## rather than a saving.[/b] A pilot's jump is the collective, their strafe keys are the
## pedals and their forward key is the cyclic — nobody has to learn a second set of
## controls for a machine they might be in for thirty seconds — so there is one thing to
## send either way and the server decides which of the two it means. A client that sent
## "collective" would be telling the server it was flying.
##
## [b]The three game buttons ride in [member DotFpsCommand.buttons] for the reason a jump
## does:[/b] they are per-tick, they are held rather than pressed once, and they have to be
## ordered against the movement they were aimed with. A shot sent as a reliable request
## would arrive a round trip later and be resolved against a position the player has
## already left.
##
## The slot is the exception and is a field of its own, because [DotFpsCommand] has eight
## buttons and no room for a number — see [member ScPlayer.wanted_slot].

## Fire, and the chopper's drop. `BUTTON_USER_0`, which dot-player-controller reserves.

## The alt-fire, which on every blaster in the pack is a bash.

## How many bits the slot takes. Eight slots is one more than the pack uses.
