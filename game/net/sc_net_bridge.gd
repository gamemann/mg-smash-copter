## [b]What is predicted, and in this game the answer is one thing.[/b] A player's own
## movement is predicted, like every other first-person game in this family. The platforms,
## the props and the choppers are all server-authoritative and NOT predicted — and the
## platforms are the interesting case, because they are the FLOOR. dot-props refuses to
## predict a crate because two solvers diverge; a floor that diverged would be a player
## falling through a platform their own machine says is holding them up, which is the worst
## possible version of that bug. So the server decides every lean and every client is told.
##
## [b]The ordering is the other half of the file.[/b] dot-net drives simulation per entity;
## this game's tick is a whole-world property — every player moves, then the platforms are
## loaded and stepped, then what landed on what is decided. [method ensure_game_ticked]
## reconciles the two: the first behaviour through on a tick runs the whole world and the
## rest find it done.
