## [b]This file is a bridge, and this family's own record says bridges are where the bugs
## are.[/b] Every addon it touches is complete and tested on its own; what has never run
## before is the joins. The three this game adds are all orderings:
##
## - a player standing on a platform has to be carried by it [i]after[/i] the motor has
##   moved them, because the motor writes an absolute position and anything applied before
##   it is simply overwritten;
## - the weight they press into that platform is reported on the same tick they were
##   standing there, not the next one, or a platform leans toward where somebody was;
## - a pilot's movement is turned OFF rather than ignored while they are flying, because
##   two authorities over one transform reads as the machine shaking itself apart.
