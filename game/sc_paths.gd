extends RefCounted

## Where this game's own files are, wherever this copy of it happens to live.
##
## [b]A delivered pack does not mount at the path its content was authored at.[/b] It
## mounts at [code]res://dot_cloud/<id>/<version>/[/code], so every absolute `res://`
## reference a game makes to its OWN files resolves against the HOST project root
## instead — which holds another game's file, or nothing. The pack mounts, the scene
## loads, and the first thing that tries to use the reference finds something else.
##
## A script knows where it is: `resource_path` is the mounted path, not the authored one.
## So this game's root is this script's directory with the `game/` segment taken off, and
## every other path hangs off that.

## Built in, [method rebase] returns exactly what it was passed, so nothing about today's
## behaviour changes. That is the point: one form that is right in both.
##
## [b]Which means anything holding one of these paths is a `static var`, not a
## `const`.[/b] A constant is folded at parse time and [method root] is not knowable then.

## This game's content root: `res://` built in, the mount prefix delivered.
static func root() -> String:
	# Through [Resource], because a const-preloaded script is typed as its own class and
	# `resource_path` is not reachable on that — "Cannot find member resource_path in
	# base res://…". The cast costs nothing and is the only spelling that compiles.
	var here: Resource = _SELF
	return here.resource_path.get_base_dir().get_base_dir()


## Moves one `res://` path onto [method root].
##
## Anything that is not a `res://` path comes back untouched, so this is safe to wrap
## around a value that may already be absolute or may be a `user://` path.
##
## Format specifiers survive: only the prefix is replaced, so
## `rebase("res://textures/%s.png") % name` works exactly as it read before.
