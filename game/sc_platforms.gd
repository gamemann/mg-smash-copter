## The field of platforms, and the one model that decides how all of them move.
##
## [b]A platform is a slab balanced on a single pillar, and everything this game is about
## comes out of that.[/b] Walk to the edge of one and it leans toward you; run to the edge
## and it leans faster; put a boulder on the far corner and it leans away. Past sixteen
## degrees it comes off the pillar and takes whoever is on it down forty metres.
##
## [b]It is not a rigid body, and that is the decision this file exists to defend.[/b] A
## slab genuinely balanced on a thin cylinder in Godot's solver is a body in permanent
## marginal contact: it jitters at rest, it is decided by contact-point ordering, and it
## is not reproducible across two machines — which in a game where the platform under your
## feet is the whole of the first objective means a client and a server that disagree
## about whether you are standing on anything. dot-props has the same finding from the
## other end and refuses to predict a crate for it.
##
## So a platform is an [AnimatableBody3D] driven by a torsion spring this file integrates:
## a lean, a lean velocity, a sink and a sink velocity, four floats that are a pure
## function of the loads on it. It is deterministic, it costs nothing, it replicates in
## four numbers, and a client can be told exactly what the server decided rather than
## asked to agree with it.
