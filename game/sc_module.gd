## This game, as a module a dedicated server loads.
##
## [b]A hundred and forty lines, against the five hand-written modules' 837 to 1,816.[/b]
## [DotGameModule] holds the netcode and its four load-bearing constants, the bridge, the
## message seal, the identity layer, the roster, the authoritative tick and a teardown in
## the reverse order. Two of those five hand-written copies had the same line wrong and
## nobody could ever join those servers. What is left here is what is actually this game's:
## the cvars an operator turns between rounds, the two console commands, and the rule that
## keeps enough people in a round for one to happen.
##
## [b]No `class_name`, and that is a requirement rather than a style.[/b]
## [method DotModuleHost.load_module] takes a PATH and constructs the module itself — it
## must, because that is the shape that lets an operator name one in a config file — and a
## module delivered inside a dot-cloud pack cannot have a `class_name` at all: a mounted
## pack's globals are not registered in the host.
##
## [codeblock]
## server.modules.load_module("res://game/sc_module.gd")
## [/codeblock]

# [b]No `const CHANNEL` here, and its absence is the point.[/b] [DotGameModule] already
# declares one and GDScript refuses to let a subclass redeclare it — which is the right
# refusal: a module logs through [method DotModule.log_info], which stamps the module's own
# name, so a second channel would split one module's records across two places an operator
# has to know to turn up separately.

## Seconds between checks of how many people are in the round.
const ROSTER_INTERVAL := 2.0

## Where the services keep punishments. Empty is [DotGameServices]'s own default,
## `user://smash-copter_punishments.json` — the store a real server enforces.
##
## [b]Static, because nothing holds this module before it exists[/b]: dot-server constructs
## it from a path inside `load_module`, so there is no instance for a host to set a field on
## first. `examples/dedicated.tscn` points it at a directory of its own; before it could,
## every run appended the live tools' audit warnings to the real store, 106 of them by the
## time anybody counted. game-simple-lobby's `RoomModule.punishments_path` is the same seam.
