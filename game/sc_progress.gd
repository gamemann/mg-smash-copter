## What a player keeps from a round: the numbers this game produces, and what they earn.
##
## [b]The numbers are the ones only this game has.[/b] A deathmatch counts kills; a floor
## game's interesting figures are about the floor — how many rounds somebody was still
## standing when the clock ran out, how many landings on their own platform they were not
## under, how many platforms went over with them on them. Each is declared once, in
## [method schema], counted as it happens and reported by dot-stats as a DELTA — "add one",
## never "now has forty" — so two servers reporting one player add up rather than overwrite.
##
## [b]Achievements are rules over those numbers and nothing else.[/b] dot-achievements never
## hears about a platform or a cannon; it hears that a number moved, through
## [DotAchievementStatsLink] — which is the differencer between dot-stats' SESSION totals
## and a lifetime total, and the reason this is not one `connect`. Wiring `recorded` straight
## into `record` would add the running total to the lifetime total on every reading.
##
## [b]Stand-ins are never counted.[/b] An empty server here is a server full of them, and an
## achievement a bot can earn is noise in every log an operator reads; a stand-in's numbers
## are also no player's numbers, so reporting them would be filing figures against nobody.
##
## [b]Server side, and on an offline client — wherever the world is authoritative.[/b] A
## connected client's world decides nothing, so it counts nothing; what a player is told is
## a notice from the server when they earn something.
##
## [b]Keys are the world's player ids[/b] — `u<session>` on a server, which dot-stats accepts
## and a site account id never is: its reporter refuses a `backbone:` key before it leaves
## the process, and a key built from a session cannot carry one. This game has no identity
## layer, so a key does not outlive a connection; the day one exists, the scoped key it
## resolves is what [method begin] should be handed instead.
