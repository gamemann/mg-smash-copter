##
## [b]A round is two games and the join between them is the whole design.[/b] For two
## minutes nobody can hurt anybody: the only threat is the floor, and the only skill is
## deciding where to stand on something that leans toward you. Then the clock runs out, the
## survivors are thrown into the corners with weapons they did not choose, and it becomes a
## fight — between exactly the people who were good at the first half. Neither half would
## be much on its own. What makes the second one work is that the people in it earned their
## place by not falling over.
##
## [b]What it owns and what it borrows.[/b] The round, the sides and the scoreboard are
## dot-match's; health and damage are dot-combat's; the props are dot-props'; the chopper is
## dot-vehicle's; the weapons are dot-weapon's through zee-dot-weapons; the platforms are
## [ScPlatforms] and are this game's own, because nothing in the family models a floor that
## tips. The joins are the part that is new, and they are the part worth reading.
