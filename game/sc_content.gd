## The two catalogues: what the cannon throws, and what a player can fly.
##
## [b]Eight props in four tiers, and the tiers are the whole of the cannon's design.[/b]
## A crate wobbles a platform, a boulder tips it, a container takes a corner off it and a
## monolith deletes it with everybody standing on it. Every one of those outcomes comes out
## of two numbers on a definition — the mass and the size — through one model in
## [ScPlatforms], rather than out of a rule per prop. That is what lets a server retune the
## whole feel of the round by editing a document, and what lets the suite assert the design
## instead of the code.

## Where the bodies live, as this game was authored.
##
## [b]Read through [method ScPaths.rebase] and never used raw.[/b] A delivered pack mounts
## at `res://dot_cloud/<id>/<version>/`, so an absolute path to this game's OWN files
## resolves against the host project root — which holds another game's props, or nothing.
