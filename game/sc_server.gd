## What a [DotServer] loads as its game scene. Never a client.
##
## [b]Small on purpose.[/b] Everything a dedicated server does is in `sc_module.gd`; this
## exists because dot-server loads a SCENE and the game needs one, and because the world has
## to be in the tree — registered under [constant ScGame.SERVICE] — before the module looks
## for it. dot-server loads the scene and then the module, in that order, for exactly this
## reason.
##
## [b]It lives in `game/`, not beside its own scene in `scenes/`.[/b] That is a deployment
## constraint rather than a preference: a game is vendored by copying its `game/` wholesale
## and its `scenes/*.tscn` — only the `.tscn` — so a script under `scenes/` is a script that
## never reaches the build. The scene then fails to load with "referenced non-existent
## resource", the module refuses to load because no game registered itself, and the server
## reports that the game loaded but its module did not. Every other game in this family keeps
## its server scene's script in `game/`, having learned it the same way.

	# a field laid out now is a dozen platforms no client is ever told about. The module
	# starts it, on the last line of its own load.
