## Where somebody who is out looks, and what the server lets them see.
##
## [b]Until this existed, falling was the end of the game for the rest of the round.[/b] The
## camera hangs off the player's own node, and a player who ran out of map is a body at the
## kill height: so the next two minutes were spent looking at the floor of the map from
## inside it, while the round that decides whether your side wins happened forty metres
## overhead. This is last-team-standing, which means the people who are out are exactly the
## people with the most reason to watch.
##
## [b]The camera part is four lines; who decides is the part that matters.[/b] dot-spectate
## computes a transform and touches no camera, and the policy — may this person watch, whom,
## through which camera — is the server's, so a client that decided for itself what it may
## look at would be a client that may look at anything. On a server this runs an
## authoritative [DotSpectatorManager]; on a connected client it runs a MIRROR that is told
## each view change in a `SPECTATE` event and computes the camera itself from the players it
## already draws. That split is what keeps the wire to one small event per decision rather
## than a camera transform per frame.
##
## [b]No delay, and it would protect nothing here.[/b] dot-spectate's delay exists because a
## spectator watching live is a live intelligence feed — but every player in this game is
## always relevant (the map is open air), so every client already receives every player's
## live position in its snapshots. A delayed spectator camera would hide nothing that the
## same client's own world is not already drawing. `delay_ticks` stays 0 and a mirror never
## needs the history a delay samples, which is also why the mirror's `advance` records none.
##
## [b]No `class_name`, like everything in this game.[/b] Reached by preload from [ScGame].
## It does not preload [ScGame] back: the world hands it the two dictionaries it reads and a
## callable for the phase, which is a smaller contract than the world and no cycle.
