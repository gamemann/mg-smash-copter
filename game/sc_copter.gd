extends DotVehicleChassis

## The chopper: a fourth kind of vehicle, because neither of dot-vehicle's two is one.
##
## [b]This file exists because [DotVehicleHover] returns early when nothing is under
## it.[/b] That is the hovercraft being right — a craft held up by ground effect has
## nothing to push against over a canyon — and it is exactly the state a helicopter spends
## its whole life in. [DotVehicleWheeled] needs wheels on a surface. So the addon's own
## extension point is the answer: `DotVehicleDef.chassis_script_path` names a script by
## PATH, dot-vehicle loads it, checks it extends this base and drives it like any other.
## Nothing in dot-vehicle is forked and nothing in it knows what a helicopter is.
##
## [b]Four controls, and only three of them fit in a [DotVehicleCommand].[/b]
##
## [codeblock]
## command.throttle  collective — jump climbs, crouch descends
## command.steer     the pedals — A and D yaw
## command.brake     the rotor brake, which is how you drop out of the sky
## vehicle.meta.cyclic  W and S, as a Vector2 the game writes each tick
## [/codeblock]
##
## The cyclic goes in the instance's `meta` rather than in the command because the command
## is dot-vehicle's wire shape and widening it would be a breaking change across every
## game that has one, for a field only an aircraft has. `meta` is the free-form dictionary
## the addon ships for exactly this.
##
## [b]It is not predicted.[/b] A helicopter is a rigid body under six forces and Godot's
## solver is not reproducible across machines, so the pilot's keys go round trip like a
## bus driver's in game-buses-from-hell — and for the same reason that is bearable: 1.4
## tonnes hanging under a rotor take about a round trip to respond to anything.

## How hard it holds itself level, in radians per second squared per radian of tip.
##
## [b]High, and a helicopter that did not would be unflyable.[/b] The real machine is
