##
## [b]Built in code and prototype-textured, like every other map in this family.[/b] There
## is no art here and there does not need to be — the whole of this game's geometry is a
## grid of squares, a cylinder and a ring of pads, and what a player has to read off it is
## height, distance and which way the floor is tilting. A one-metre grid is better at all
## three than a texture would be.
##
## [b]The floor is drawn even though nobody survives touching it.[/b] Forty metres of
## nothing under a platform is a drop a player cannot judge; forty metres of grid going
## past is a drop they can count. It is also the only thing on screen that tells somebody
## who has just fallen that they are falling rather than that the game has stopped.

##
## [b]Clear of the rim, and the first version was not.[/b] A body spawned overlapping the

## [b]Added 2026-09-26, because a flat ring is not worth taking.[/b] The ring is "the
## thing worth taking" and the catwalks the only way to it, and until then it was the
## most exposed floor in the sky: a survivor who walked onto it stood in every pad's line
## of fire with nothing between, so the showdown was six people holding their pads. A
## block chest high, facing a pad, is somewhere to hold the ring FROM against that pad,
## which is what makes committing to the walk a plan.
##
## [b]Facing the pads, not between the catwalks,[/b] which is where the first draft put
## them: the pads stand on the catwalk lines, so a block between two catwalks is end-on to
## both and covers nobody from either. Half-way in, so a survivor coming off a catwalk has
## seven metres of floor before it and walks round it; `headless_run`'s walk onto the ring
## stops two metres inside the rim and never reaches one.

## The kerb this function's own name has promised since it was written.
##
## [b]It was documented in two places and built in neither.[/b] [constant CORNER_LIP] had a
## doc comment explaining why the lip is low and is not cover, `_pad` was described as "one
## flat surface with a kerb around it", and no line anywhere put one in the world — which is
## the same shape of gap as a value produced correctly and consumed by nothing, and just as
## invisible to a suite. A render of the showdown is what found it: three flat shapes
## floating against a flat sky with no edge on any of them.
##
## Two things, and they do different jobs. The BAND is drawn a hair proud of the surface
## with no collider, so an edge seen almost edge-on is still a line — that is the fix the
## platforms already have. The KERB is a real collider standing on the band, low enough to
## walk over deliberately and high enough to stop a body sliding off something its owner was
## not looking at. Falling stays this map's one rule; what a kerb removes is the death
## nobody chose.
## [param ends] is false for a catwalk, and that is not a detail.
##
## A catwalk's two SHORT edges are its junctions with the pad at one end and the ring at the
## other, so a kerb there is a step across the walkway rather than a rail beside it — a third
## of a metre high, at the exact moment a player is running for cover. It cost nothing to see
## in a render and would have been very hard to read as a bug from inside the game: a body
## that catches on it reads as the movement code being wrong.
##
## [b]And it is open where a catwalk arrives, which it was not until 2026-09-23.[/b] The
## paragraph above kept the catwalk's own ends clear and the pad's and the ring's kerbs ran
## straight across the same junctions from the other side — so a survivor walking to the
## ring was stopped at their own pad's edge, running or walking, and stopped again at the
## ring's. dot-player-controller's step-up does not take a 0.34 m kerb 0.6 m deep. The
## suite's "a pad is edged on four sides" counted the kerbs and passed; the reach section
## now walks a survivor from their corner onto the ring, and that failed first.
