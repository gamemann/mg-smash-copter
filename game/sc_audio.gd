## What this game makes a noise about, and the noise, on the client.
##
## [b]Until this existed the game made no sound at all, and in THIS game that is not a
## polish item.[/b] The cannon is behind you as often as in front of you, and the only
## warning a player standing on a platform gets of a monolith on its way is looking up at
## the right moment. The one warning that works without looking is a bang from the middle of
## the map — and the second is the platform under your feet creaking before it goes, which
## is information the tilt bar gives only to somebody reading it.
##
## [b]A catalogue of ids and a table of stand-ins, which is the family's shape.[/b] dot-audio
## decides what is audible, how many at once, how far away it stops mattering and what loses
## to what; [method sound_catalogue] is those decisions, as a document naming paths nobody
## has produced yet. [method sound_recipes] says which synthesised voice stands in for each
## id until they are — and [DotAudioSinkGodot] consults the file before the stand-in, so
## dropping a real `.ogg` into `audio/` switches that one id over with no code change.
##
## [b]Never on a server, and never deciding anything.[/b] Every hook here is called by
## [ScClient] from something the world or the wire already said, and none of them changes
## the simulation — so a client still downloading content, a machine with no sound card and
## a headless suite all run the same code and differ only in whether a speaker moves.
## dot-audio picks its own null sink when there is no device.
##
## [b]The beacon's ping is not here, deliberately.[/b] [ScBeacon] synthesises its own tone
## on its own [AudioStreamPlayer3D], and `headless_run` pins its rate to once a second; it
## predates this layer and moving it is a change to a tested behaviour with nothing to gain
## but tidiness. The day real audio ships, `beacon` is the id it moves to.
