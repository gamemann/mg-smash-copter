## The clock, the health, and the two numbers that say whether this is still winnable.
##
## [b]How many platforms are left is the number that is not obvious and is the most
## important of the four.[/b] Health says how many mistakes you have left and the clock says
## how long you have to survive; neither says whether surviving is still possible. The
## platform count does: a field down to its last three is a field where standing still has
## stopped working, and a player who watches that number fall starts moving before it is too
## late rather than after.
##
## [b]And the lean of the floor you are on, which nothing else could tell you.[/b] A player
## in first person looking at the horizon cannot see the platform under their feet; the one
## in third person can see it and cannot judge it. Ten degrees is the number, and the bar
## goes red at the angle a player starts sliding.

# No `const CHANNEL`. This draws numbers from state somebody else owns and has nothing an
# operator would act on; the round, the deaths and the collapses are logged by [ScGame],
# which is where the decisions are. A channel declared and never used is a file that meant
# to say something and does not.

## Radians of lean at which the tilt bar goes red. The angle a player slides at.

## bearings: the clock, the phase and their own health still say the round is going on and
## that they are in it, which is what makes it read as "an admin did this" rather than as a
## client that stopped drawing.
##
## [b]But not under the tilt bar, which a blind hides.[/b] The bar is the floor under their
## feet drawn as a number — in this game the one thing their eyes would have told them —
## and a blind that left it would leave a player who can still balance by instrument.
