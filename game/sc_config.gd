extends DotConfig

## Every number this game has, layered like every other [DotConfig] in the family.
##
## [code]exported defaults < JSON file < environment < command line[/code], identically to
## dot-server, dot-cloud and the other six games. Nothing here reads
## [code]OS.get_cmdline_args[/code] itself.
##
## [b]Metres and seconds.[/b] The map this game is built from is authored in a
## twenty-year-old community's units and every length below was converted once, here, at
## the boundary — a platform is 10.5 m because 564 of that engine's units is 10.74 m. A
## second set of units inside the game would be a second place a ratio can drift, and
## unlike game-g2gfast nothing here has to be comparable with anybody else's numbers.
##
## [b]Nearly all of it is live.[/b] `ScModule` turns the two dozen an operator actually
## wants between rounds into cvars, and each of those writes through to this object rather
## than keeping a second copy of the number.

# --- The round -------------------------------------------------------------

@export_group("The round")

## Seconds the survival phase runs before the survivors are sent to the corners.
##
## [b]The first objective, and the longer half of the round.[/b] Everybody is on the

## Seconds the showdown runs before the round is called on the clock.
##
## A showdown that ran for ever would be two people hiding in opposite corners of a map
## that is mostly air, so it ends — as a draw if nobody has won.
@export_range(10.0, 900.0, 5.0) var showdown_seconds: float = 90.0

## Seconds between the survival phase ending and the showdown starting.
##
## [b]Not zero, and the reason is the teleport.[/b] Everybody is moved across the map and

# --- Sides -----------------------------------------------------------------

@export_group("Sides")

## How many teams the server plays with. Two is red against blue.
##
## [b]Up to six, and the ceiling is a decision rather than a limit of anything.[/b] Six
## teams is six corners, and the map has four proper corners and two ends; beyond that
## the showdown stops being a fight between sides and becomes a free-for-all with
## bookkeeping. [ScConfig.validate] refuses more.

## What fraction of [member run_speed] holding the walk key gives.

## [b]Shift is a brake here, not a sprint, which is the opposite of every other game in
## this family.[/b] A platform is destabilised in proportion to how hard the people on it
## are moving — see [member platform_motion_gain] — so walking is the only way to cross a
## platform somebody else is already standing on the far side of. Binding that to the key
## every player already holds down to go faster is the joke the map is built on.

## Metres per second squared, for everything: players, props and the chopper.
##
## [b]Here rather than in `project.godot`, because a project setting does not travel with
## a delivered game.[/b] A pack mounted into the server tool's project runs at ITS
## setting, and nothing reports the difference: what it looks like is a game that plays
## correctly on a developer's machine and floats everywhere it is deployed. Applied to the
## world's own physics space by [ScGame], because a server and a client in one process are
## two worlds and a global would be one of them deciding for the other.

## Metres between the centres of two platforms along the rows.
##

## fall down and a jump they have to mean.
@export_range(2.0, 60.0, 0.1) var column_pitch: float = 11.4

## Metres between the two rows of platforms.

## The radius of the single pillar under each platform, in metres.
##
## [b]One pillar, in the middle, and everything about this game comes out of it.[/b] A

## on it moves off centre, and that is the entire first objective.
@export_range(0.2, 8.0, 0.05) var pillar_radius: float = 1.35

## How hard a platform pushes itself back level, in radians per second squared per radian.
##
## Lower is a wobblier map. [member ScSpecials] turns this down for a whole round.

## How much of a platform's lean speed is bled off per second.
##
## [b]Under-damped on purpose.[/b] At critical damping a platform leans and stops, which

## back is one a player can feel moving under them.
@export_range(0.0, 50.0, 0.05) var platform_damping: float = 1.55

## The rotational inertia of a platform, in arbitrary but consistent units.
##
## Everything a load does to a platform is divided by this, so it is the one number that
## trades "a person can tip it" against "a person cannot tip it alone".
@export_range(1.0, 100000.0, 10.0) var platform_inertia: float = 2600.0

## How much a load standing off centre leans the platform, per kilogram per metre.
##
## [b]Measured against the equilibrium a real player reaches, not chosen.[/b] A platform
## settles where the spring balances the load, which is
## `lean = offset * kilos * gain / (inertia * stiffness)` — so at a gain of 1.0 one person
## standing on the very edge of a 10.5 m platform leans it by 1.1 degrees and one RUNNING
## across it by 3.3, against a collapse angle of sixteen. At those numbers nobody can tip
## anything, the walk key does nothing a player could feel, and the first objective is
## standing still for two minutes. At 1.8 a lone runner leans it six degrees, three of them
## on one edge take it over, and shift is the difference.
@export_range(0.0, 100.0, 0.05) var platform_load_gain: float = 1.8

## How much harder a running load pushes than a still one.
##
## [b]This is the walk key.[/b] At zero a platform does not care how fast anybody on it is
## moving and shift does nothing; at 2.0 a sprinting player is three times the load of a
## standing one and crossing a platform at speed throws it. See [member walk_speed_scale].
@export_range(0.0, 10.0, 0.05) var platform_motion_gain: float = 2.0

## Radians of lean past which a platform comes off its pillar and falls.
##
## About sixteen degrees by default, which is a little past what a player can stand on:
## the platform is already sliding people off before it goes.
@export_range(0.05, 1.2, 0.005) var platform_collapse_lean: float = 0.28

## How much punishment a platform takes before it collapses, in kilogram metres per second.
##
## Impacts add up. A platform that has been hit twice is one more hit from gone, and
## nothing on the HUD says so — the lean does.
@export_range(1.0, 1000000.0, 50.0) var platform_toughness: float = 5200.0

## A single impact this big collapses a platform outright, whatever its health.
##
## [b]The explosive case, and it is what a tier-four prop is for.[/b] Below it an impact
## tilts and wobbles; at it the platform is simply gone, with whoever was on it.
@export_range(1.0, 1000000.0, 50.0) var platform_shatter_impulse: float = 4200.0

## How much of an impact becomes lean rather than damage.

## Whether the pillar goes down with the platform it was holding up.
##
## [b]Off, and a bare pillar is the point.[/b] What is left behind is a marker a player
## can read from across the map: that one is gone, do not run that way. A pillar that
## vanished with its platform would leave a hole in the sky nobody can judge.
@export var pillar_falls_with_platform: bool = false

## How slippery a platform is, as a multiplier on the ground friction.

## One is ordinary footing. [member ScSpecials] takes it down for the ice round.

# --- The layout ------------------------------------------------------------

@export var vary_layout: bool = true

## Seed the layouts, the cannon and the special rounds are all drawn from.
##
## [b]A seed rather than a fixed schedule, and it is reproducible on purpose.[/b] Two
## servers on the same seed play the same round, which is what makes a bug report about
## "the platform that went at forty seconds" mean anything — and what lets the suite
## assert against a round at all. [DotRandom] rather than [code]randi()[/code], for the
## family's reason: the global generator is shared with everything else in the process.

## What that interval is multiplied by by the end of the survival phase.
##

## Metres above the deck a launched prop is aimed to reach at the top of its arc.
##

## The largest prop tier the cannon may fire. 1 is crates only, 4 is everything.
##

## How likely each tier is, relative to the others. Four numbers, smallest prop first.
##
## [b]Weighted, not uniform, and heavily toward the small end.[/b] A map where every

## How many props may be in the air and on the platforms at once.
##
## A cap on the physics rather than on the design: past a few dozen rigid bodies the
## server's step cost is what decides the round.
@export_range(4, 400, 1) var prop_budget: int = 110

## Seconds a launched prop lives before it is taken away, however it landed.
##
## [b]Not forever, and not on landing.[/b] A prop that stayed would turn every platform
## into a pile of crates by the end of the round, and one that vanished the moment it
## stopped would take away the cover a player just earned. A minute is long enough to

## Which specials this server may draw, by id. Empty means all of them.

## Metres above the deck a chopper may not climb past.
##
## A ceiling, because the whole point of the machine is being above the platforms and a

@export_range(2.0, 400.0, 1.0) var chopper_ceiling: float = 52.0

## Whether the pilot may drop props out of it.
##
## [b]The map this is built from has exactly this and it is the best thing in it.[/b] A

## How many weapons each survivor is given.
@export_range(1, 8, 1) var weapons_granted: int = 2

## Which weapons may be drawn, by id from the pack. Empty means a sensible default set.
##
## [b]Ids, never models.[/b] `zee-dot-weapons` names its weapons by the role they play —

## Whether both survivors of a team get the same draw.

## How many players the server keeps in the round by adding stand-ins.
##
## [b]Zero on a busy server and four on an empty one.[/b] Unlike a deathmatch, one person
