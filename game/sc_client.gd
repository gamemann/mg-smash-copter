## One local player, a camera and a HUD over an [ScGame] — offline, or against a server.
##
## [b]One client for both, and the offline half is not a demo mode.[/b] It is the same world
## class with `authoritative` true and nothing else different: the same platforms, the same
## cannon, the same rules. What changes is where the answers come from, and the whole of
## that difference is [ScNetBridge]. A separate single-player build would be a second game to
## keep in step, and this family has watched two copies of one thing drift more than once.
##
## [b]Which half runs is decided by whether there is a link in the registry.[/b] A dot-server
## client publishes a [DotClientLink] under `dot_client_link` before the game scene loads; no
## link means nobody connected us to anything, and the honest answer to that is a playable
## field rather than an error. `--offline` forces it.
##
## [b]First person and third, and the motor does not know which.[/b] The camera is
## presentation: the simulation is first-person, command-driven and predictable in both, and
## what changes is where the camera sits. That is the line dot-player-controller draws
## between its motor and its view, drawn again here — and it matters more in this game than
## in most, because the thing a player most needs to see is the platform under their own
## feet, which is the one thing a first-person camera cannot show them.
