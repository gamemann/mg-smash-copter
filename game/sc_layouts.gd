## What shape the platform field takes this round, as a catalogue of documents.
##
## [b]The same platforms in a different arrangement is a different round to play, and it
## costs nothing.[/b] This map's geometry is a grid of squares on pillars; knocking a
## column out of it, taking the bridges away, or pushing the rows apart changes where a
## player can go and therefore where the cannon can corner them — which is the whole of
## the first objective. A round that always looked the same would be a round players
## solve once.
##
## [b]A document rather than a scene each, for the family's usual reason and one of its
## own.[/b] A layout is six numbers, so the whole catalogue travels in the HELLO as one
## id and a client rebuilds the identical field from it. A layout that was a `.tscn` would
## be content to deliver, to version and to keep in step across two machines, in exchange
## for nothing this cannot express.

## with the dip their own run puts in the lip they leave from — and a kind it does not name
## has to be OUTSIDE it, because "nobody is crossing" is as much a promise as "every jump is
## a diagonal". Every pair is read off the built field rather than written down, so moving a
## platform moves the jump with it. See [method pairs] and `headless_run`'s reach section.
