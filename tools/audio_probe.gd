## Asks whether this game actually makes a noise, on a machine that has a sound card.
##
## [b]Every assertion in `headless_run` about this game's audio passes on a machine that
## cannot make one.[/b] A headless run has no audio device, so [DotAudioManager] correctly
## builds a [DotAudioSinkNull] and the suite asserts against the real manager recording
## instead of playing — which proves the catalogue, the stand-ins, the culling and the
## creak's hysteresis, and cannot prove a speaker moves. This is the audio half of what
## `tools/shot.sh` is for the picture.
##
## [b]It asks `is_playing`, not "did I get a handle"[/b], which is the lesson another game
## in this family's first probe paid for: a handle for a voice that never sounded reads as a
## sound. And it runs in `_process`, because during `_initialize` the root viewport is not
## live and an [AudioStreamPlayer] under it refuses to play.

## One of each kind that matters here: the warning from the middle of the map, the creak
## under your feet, a flat sound that is about you rather than a place, and a shot.
